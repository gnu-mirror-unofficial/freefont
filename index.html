Outline Fonts</A></H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Summary: This project aims to provide a set of free outline
(PostScript Type0, TrueType, OpenType...) fonts covering the ISO
10646/Unicode UCS (Universal Character Set).</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Why do we need free outline UCS fonts?</H2>

<P>A large number of free software users switched from free
X11 bitmapped fonts to proprietary Microsoft Truetype fonts, as a)
they used to be freely downloaded from <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/free.htm">Microsoft
Typography page</A>, b) they contain a more or less decent subset of
the ISO 10646 UCS (Universal Character Set), c) they are high-quality,
well hinted scalable Truetype fonts, and d) <A
HREF="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype</A>, a free high-quality
Truetype font renderer is available and has been integrated into the
latest release of XFree86, the free X11 server.</P>

<P>Building a dependence on non-free software, even a niche one like
fonts, is dangerous. Microsoft Truetype core fonts were never free,
they were just costless. Citing the <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq8.htm">TrueType core
fonts for the Web FAQ</A>: <EM>You may only redistribute the fonts in
their original form (.exe or .sit.hqx) and with their original file
name from your Web site or intranet site. You must not supply the
fonts, or any derivative fonts based on them, in any form that adds
value to commercial products, such as CD-ROM or disk based multimedia
programs, application software or utilities.</EM> As of August 2002,
however, the fonts are not anymore available on the Web, which makes
the situation clearer.</P>

<P>Don't there exist any free high-quality outline fonts? Yes, they
do.  URW++, a German digital typefoundry, released their own version
of the 35 Postscript Type 1 core fonts under GPL as their <A
HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/378/1996/5/0/2064811/">donation
to the Ghostscript project</A>. The Wadalab Kanji comittee has
produced <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/Font/">Type 1 font
files with thousands of filigree Japanese glyphs</A>. Yannis
Haralambous has drawn beautiful glyphs for the <A
HREF="http://omega.cse.unsw.edu.au:8080/">Omega typesetting
system</A>. And so on. Scattered around the internet there are
numerous other free resources for other national scripts, many of them
aiming to be a suitable match for Latin fonts like Times or
Helvetica.</P>


<H2>What do we plan to achieve, and how?</H2>

<P>Our aim is to collect available <A
HREF="resources.html">resources</A>, fill in the missing pieces, and
provide a set of free high-quality outline (OpenType, Truetype, Type
0) UCS fonts, released under GNU GPL.</P>

<P>Free UCS outline fonts will cover the following character sets</P>
<UL>
<LI>ISO 8859 parts 1-15 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/pdf/cwa13873.pdf">CEN
    MES-3 European Unicode Subset</A>
<LI>IBM/Microsoft code pages 437, 850, 852, 1250, 1252 and more
<LI><A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/opentype/appendices/wgl4.html">Microsoft/Adobe Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)</A>
<LI>KOI8-R and KOI8-U
<LI>DEC VT100 graphics symbols
<LI>International Phonetic Alphabet
<LI>Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopian, Thai and Lao alphabets,
  including Arabic presentation forms A/B
<LI>Japanese Katakana and Hiragana
<LI>mathematical symbols, including the whole TeX repertoire of symbols
<LI>APL symbols
  etc.
</UL>

<P>A free Postscript font editor, George Williams's <A
HREF="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/">Pfaedit</A> will be used for
creating new glyphs.</P>

<P>Which font shapes should be made? As historical style terms like
Renaissance or Baroque letterforms cannot be applied beyond
Latin/Cyrillic/Greek scripts to any greater extent than Kufi or Nashki
can be applied beyond Arabic script, a smaller subset of styles will
be made: one monospaced - <tt>FreeMono</tt> and two proportional (one
with uniform stroke - <tt>FreeSans</tt> - and one with modulated -
<tt>FreeSerif</tt>) will be made at the start.</P>

<P>These minimal style requirements allow the typefaces to preserve
the same characteristic spirit regardless of the scripts, so that the
font will be a harmonic unity. Some <A
HREF="design-notes.html">design notes</A> on individual typefaces
are available.</P>

<P>In the beginning, however, we don't believe that Truetype hinting
will be good enough to compete with neither the hand-crafted bitmapped
fonts at small sizes, nor with commercial TrueType fonts. A companion
program for modifying the TrueType font tables, <A
HREF="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/TtfMod/">TtfMod</A>, is in the
works, though. For applications like <TT>xterm</TT>, users are
referred to the existing <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html">UCS bitmap
fonts</A>.

<H2>Downloading fonts</H2>

<P>Tar archives, compressed with gzip, are available on the
Savannah download area</P>
<UL>
<LI><A
HREF="http://freesoftware.fsf.org/download/freefont/">http://freesoftware.fsf.org/download/freefont/</A>
</UL>

<P>There you will find several archive files, depending on the
format of fonts. A <TT>-source-</TT> package contains 
font files with a <TT>.sfd</TT> (Spline Font Database) suffix.
This is PfaEdit's native format. Please use these if you plan to modify the
font files. PfaEdit can export these to mostly any existing font file
format.</P>

<P>TrueType fonts for immediate consumption are in the
<TT>-ttf-</TT> tag. Font files have the
<TT>.ttf</TT> (TrueType Font) suffix. You can use them directly,
e.g. with the X font server.</P>

<P>OpenType fonts are in the
<TT>-otf-</TT> tag. Font files have the
<TT>.otf</TT> (OpenType Font) suffix.</P>

<P>Finally, there is a <TT>-sample-</TT> package.
The files with <TT>.ps</TT> (PostScript) suffix are not font files
at all - they are merely PostScript files with glyph tables, which can
be used for overview, which glyphs are contained in which font file.</P>

<P>You may have noticed the lack of PostScript Type 1
(<TT>.pfa</TT>/<TT>.pfb</TT>) font files. Type 1 format does not
support large (> 256) encoding vectors, so they can not be used with
ISO 10646 encoding. If your printer supports it, you can use Type 0
format, though. Please use PfaEdit for conversion to Type 0.</P>

<H3>Debian GNU/Linux</H3>

<P>Users of <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A>
system can download a <tt>.deb</tt> package from the <A
HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html">Debian
Web site</a>.
