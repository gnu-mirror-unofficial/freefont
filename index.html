<H1>Free UCS Scalable Fonts</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Summary: This project aims to provide a set of free scalable
(PostScript Type0, TrueType, OpenType...) fonts covering the ISO
10646/Unicode UCS (Universal Character Set).</EM></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Why do we need free scalable UCS fonts?</H2>

<P>An increasing number of free software users is switching from free
X11 bitmapped fonts to proprietary Microsoft Truetype fonts, as a)
they can be freely downloaded from <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/free.htm">Microsoft
Typography page</A>, b) they contain a more or less decent subset of
the ISO 10646 UCS (Universal Character Set), c) they are high-quality,
well hinted scalable Truetype fonts, and d) <A
HREF="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype</A>, a free high-quality
Truetype font renderer is available and has been integrated into the
latest release of XFree86, the free X11 server.</P>

<P>Building a dependence on non-free software, even a niche one like
fonts, is dangerous. Microsoft Truetype core fonts are not free, they
are just costless. For now, at least. Citing the <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq8.htm">TrueType core
fonts for the Web FAQ</A>: <EM>You may only redistribute the fonts in
their original form (.exe or .sit.hqx) and with their original file
name from your Web site or intranet site. You must not supply the
fonts, or any derivative fonts based on them, in any form that adds
value to commercial products, such as CD-ROM or disk based multimedia
programs, application software or utilities.</EM></P>

<P>Don't there exist any free high-quality scalable fonts? Yes, they
do.  URW++, a German digital typefoundry, released their own version
of the 35 Postscript Type 1 core fonts under GPL as their <A
HREF="http://www.gimp.org/fonts.html">donation to the Ghostscript
project</A>. The Wadalab Kanji comittee has produced <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/Font/">Type 1 font files with
thousands of filigree Japanese glyphs</A>. Yannis Haralambous has
drawn beautiful glyphs for the <A
HREF="http://omega.cse.unsw.edu.au:8080/">Omega typesetting
system</A>. And so on. Scattered around the internet there are
numerous other free resources for other national scripts, many of them
aiming to be a suitable match for Latin fonts like Times or
Helvetica.</P>


<H2>What do we plan to achieve, and how?</H2>

<P>Our aim is to collect available resources, fill in the missing pieces,
and provide a set of free high-quality scalable (Type 1 and Truetype)
UCS fonts, released under GPL.</P>

<P>Free UCS scalable fonts will cover the following character sets</P>
<UL>
<LI>ISO 8859 parts 1-15 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/pdf/cwa13873.pdf">CEN
    MES-3 European Unicode Subset</A>
<LI>IBM/Microsoft code pages 437, 850, 852, 1250, 1252 and more
<LI><A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/opentype/appendices/wgl4.html">Microsoft/Adobe Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)</A>
<LI>KOI8-R and KOI8-RU
<LI>DEC VT100 graphics symbols
<LI>International Phonetic Alphabet
<LI>Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopian, Thai and Lao alphabets,
  including Arabic presentation forms A/B
<LI>Japanese Katakana and Hiragana
<LI>mathematical symbols, including the whole TeX repertoire of symbols
<LI>APL symbols
  etc.
</UL>

<P>A free Postscript font editor, George Williams's <A
HREF="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/">Pfaedit</A> will be used for
creating new glyphs.</P>

<P>Which font shapes should be made? As historical style terms like
Renaissance or Baroque letterforms cannot be applied beyond
Latin/Cyrillic/Greek scripts to any greater extent than Kufi or Nashki
can be applied beyond Arabic script, a smaller subset of styles will
be made: one monospaced and two proportional (one with uniform stroke
and one with modulated) will be made at the start.</P>

<P>In the beginning, however, we don't believe that Truetype hinting
will be good enough to compete with neither the hand-crafted bitmapped
fonts at small sizes, nor with commercial TrueType fonts. A companion
program for modifying the TrueType font tables, <A
HREF="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/TtfMod/">TtfMod</A>, is in the
works, though. For applications like <TT>xterm</TT>, users are
referred to the existing <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html">UCS bitmap
fonts</A>.

<H2>What do the file suffices mean?</H2>

<P>The files with <TT>.sfd</TT> (Spline Font Database) are in
PfaEdit's native format. Please use these if you plan to modify the
font files. PfaEdit can export these to mostly any existing font file
format.</P>

<P>TrueType fonts for immediate consumption are the files with the
<TT>.ttf</TT> (TrueType Font) suffix. You can use them directly,
e.g. with the X font server.</P>

<P>The files with <TT>.ps</TT> (PostScript) suffix are not font files
at all - they are merely PostScript files with glyph tables, which can
be used for overview, which glyphs are contained in which font file.</P>

<P>You may have noticed the lack of PostScript Type 1
(<TT>.pfa</TT>/<TT>.pfb</TT>) font files. Type 1 format does not
support large (> 256) encoding vectors, so they can not be used with
ISO 10646 encoding. If your printer supports it, you can use Type 0
format, though. Please use PfaEdit for conversion to Type 0.</P>
