Combining diacriticals

Looks like there are two techniques at the same time.
One is to make zero-width character, far offset from 0.
Other is to use "anchoring marks", whatever.

According to FontForge docs on anchoring marks
file:///home/swhite/fontforge.sourceforge.net/editexample6.html#Marks
anchoring does not work in all apps.  Is an OpenType thing.

This gives very fine control of placement of things like diacritics:
Is controlled from GPOS 'mark' lookup
NOTE In Serif, so far there is only an "above" mark table.  Needs also "below".

So long as SansSerif is used Firefox 
a&#x0360;b
and gedit, this 
a͠b
puts a thingy over two letters
But what do these mean for monospace?

It only works because the character itself is zero width
a͠b
aˋc Aˋ
à
This approach is very crude: there is no adjustment of the horizontal
placement of the letter according to the width of the letter it modifies.

Some of these seem to be taken care of some other way.
(or are coming from a different font?)

Many are not refreshed well in gedit.

o͜a o͝a o͞a o͟a o͠a o͡a o͢a
oͣ oͤ oͥ oͦ oͧ oͨ oͩ oͪ oͫ oͬ oͭ oͮ oͯ

In FreeSans, a third method is used: mark-to-mark positioning.
(perhaps a way to chain marks?)

NOTE: different applications apply different mechanisms for finding a diacritic when one is missing.  Some (gedit) will look in other fonts of that face--the results are not always nice, and quite confusing for development.  Others (kedit) do not look in other faces.

it has an abvm table, but only has a few marks in it.
OK, it's clearer in kedit.   It just doesn't do the replacements that aren't directly represented (also, doesn't do replacements where the mark is a reference).

Some of the marks don't go right over the letter, but far to the right.
Is there a 'mark' for that?
=======================================
Note: A-acute is above baseline

Cyrillic contains several diacritics, and I don't understand some of them.
