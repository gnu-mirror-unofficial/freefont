<h1>Caveats 
</h1>

<p>
These web pages can display character ranges and test features of
GNU FreeFont on your system, but you should understand that they
have some limitations.
</p>
<p>
First, they will display something even if GNU FreeFont is not installed
at all.  All modern operating systems will find glyphs from other fonts,
if a glyph is not found in the desired font.  
</p>
<p>
Next, even if GNU FreeFont is installed, it is not always clear 
<em>which copy</em>  of FreeFont is being applied.   This is especially
tricky in X-Windows systems, where font files may be laying in many
forms in different places in the system.  But it could happen in 
any system.  So if you think FreeFont is misbehaving on your system,
make a search of your system disk for other copies of the font files.
</p>
<p>
There may be a dependency on web browser and other software.  It is 
usually a good idea to be using recent web browser versions.
